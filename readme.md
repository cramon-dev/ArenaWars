# What is this?
Arena Wars is a 3D, multiplayer action video game. Users choose to fight to the death as one of three classes: warrior, assassin, or sorcerer. The game is entirely browser-based and free to play, meaning there is no client to install and no barrier or entry. Although I am trying my best to make this a fun experience, do note that this is still a work in progress and the quality as it stands is not indicative of the final game.
